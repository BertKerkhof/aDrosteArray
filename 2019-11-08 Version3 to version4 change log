Version3 to version4 change log:
================================

The aim of version4 is a return to basics for educational purpose.

Less used functions aRound(), aDec(), aHex(), aCompare(),
  msBrace(), aSquare(), StringUtfArray() ArrayUtfString(),
  StringFromArray(), ArrayFromString(), WriteArray() and
  ReadArray() are discontinued.

The GetA() function is surpassed by the ($Array[$I])[$J] construct.

aNewArray() is renamed to aNew().
aNew() has one parameter, supports single-dimensioned arrays only.
aConcat() is renamed to Array().

sRecite() now can have a numeric value as separator parameter.
  In that case the outputted array elements will be right-justified.

aDrosteArray no longer depends on the modules FileJuggler and
  StringElaborate. A new dependency is on GitHub published module
  StringSupport.
