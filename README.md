# aDrosteArray
Basic array-in-array routines for use with AutoIT

The Clipper programming language knew flexible array functions. Here are functions that offer the same with the AutoIT interpreter and compiler. When you have the hang of programming with lists and array's, it boost productivity. I finished several jobs with aDroste array's. Comments and additions are welcome.
