; 2018-06-11 aDrosteArray 2.0 ChangeLog

; ++ Version 1.0 was introduced silently and only has a few users
;    so the liberty is taken to rename a few functions:
;         rRecite()  =>  sRecite()
;         aMax()  =>  MaxA()
;         aMin()  =>  MinA()
;    The new names better reflect the type of the return value or
;    the type of parameter.
; ++ Repaired error in aInsert() when inserting multiple elements
;    at once.
; ++ StringFromArray() and ArrayFromString() now also work for
;    array's with zero elements.
; ++ Increased the # of parameters aConcat(), aD() and aFlat()can
;    receive to 16.
; ++ aDroste() now also can take 2dim array input.
; ++ Changed array memory allocation from incremental to dynamic in:
;    aNewArray() aAdd() and aInsert().
;    Physical array dimensions are now automatically maintained at
;    16, 32, 64, 128, 256 .. and so forth, depending on need.
;    Advantage: speed increase of functions aAdd() and aInsert().
;    This change discourages the use of Ubound(). The count property
;    that is held in the element with index zero, is not affected.
;    For programs that always read the count property to determine
;    the number of array elements, no code change is necessary.
;    For a hands-on experience of the working of dynamic memory
;    allocation, see TestNewDim().
; ++ Redim is removed from aConcat() aDelete() and aLeft().
; ++ Learn about the differences between zquare array's and the
;    array-in-array principle with TestzSquareAndaDroste().
; ++ Error reports are more detailed.
; ++ Added functions: sHex() msBrace() aSquare() and Lif()
; ++ The use of GetA() is discouraged because after reading in the
;    help files under: Language Reference => Variables => Data types in
;    array's, it appeared that an array stored inside another can be
;    accessed directly. To directly assign values to an array inside
;    another is no solution other than SetA() and IncrA().
; ++ aDrosteArray dependents on StringElaborate and FileJuggler which
;    both are published at GitHub.
